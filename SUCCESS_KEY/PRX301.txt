xml gives you a way of packaging your data, and it's taken off largely because xml documents are text | which has meant that you can send them using the existing internet framework, as built for html.
notes, working drafts, candidate recommendations | and recommendations
an xml element is the basic data-holding construct in an xml document | it starts with an opening tag, can contain text or other elements, and ends with a closing tag, like this: <greeting>hello</greeting>
an attribute gives you more information, and is always assigned a quoted value in xml. | here's how you might add an attribute named language to this element: <greeting language = "en">hello</greeting>.
he ones we discussed today are that an xml document must contain one or more elements. one element, the root element, must contain all the other elements. | finally, each element must nest inside any enclosing elements correctly.
all xml processors are supposed to implement at least the utf-8 (compressed unicode) and utf-16 (compressed ucs) character encodings | in practice, you can only count on utf-8, however
you can escape < and > like this: <message>this is a &lt;message&gt; | element.</message>
a prolog can contain xml declarations, xml comments (which describe the xml document) | processing instructions, whitespace, and doctype declaration(s).
the attributes you can use in an xml document are: version (required; the xml version), encoding (optional; the character encoding), and standalone (optional; "yes" | if the document does not refer to any external documents or entities, "no" otherwise).
there are no processing instructions built into xml already, although some, like <?xml-stylesheet?> | have been generally agreed upon by browser manufacturers.
one. you need at least a root element for an xml document | to be well-formed
in a well-formed xml document, there must be one root element that contains | all the others.
he attribute values are not enclosed in | quotation marks.
you could use this attribute xmlns:service="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_service" in an element | after using this attribute, you can use the service prefix in the current element and any child elements.
use this attribute in the enclosing element | xmlns="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_returns"
the <hiredate> and <name> elements are | not declared in the dtd
the <hiredate> and <name> elements appear | in the wrong order.
this dtd uses a choice for the <employee> element, and the choice says that the document can contain | either <hiredate> elements or <name> elements—but not both.
the dtd says there can be at most one <employee> element | but there are two
this xml document references an external dtd, so the xml declaration's standalone attribute should be set to "no". | there may also be errors in the external dtd, of course.
you can use the #implied keyword | address cdata #implied
you can use the #fixed keyword. | name cdata #required
the namespace that is used by xml schemas is | www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema
you can declare elements by using <xsd:element> | and attributes by using <xsd:attribute>
you can declare the element like this | <xsd:element name="name" type="xsd:string"/>
you can do this in an xml schema: | <xsd:attribute name="language" type="xsd:string" use="optional"/>.
you use the <xsd:restriction> element | and the base attribute.
to cap values, you can use the maxincusive and maxexclusive facets. | to constrain values to be one of a set, you can use the enumeration facet.
you can use this css property/value pair: font-size: 36pt | you can use this css property/value pair: display: block
you can use this css property/value pair: text-align: center | you can use this css property/value pair: text-decoration: underline.  you can use this css property/value pair: margin-top: 10.
* by itself applied to ch09_01.xml just picks out the <states> element. * selects all element children (not grandchildren or any descendents) | of the context node, and when you open ch09_01.xml, the root node is the context node.
the xpath expression //* selects all elements in | ch09_01.xml
the first xsl-fo element you must use in an xsl-fo document is | the <fo:root> element.
the <fo:root> element can contain both a master set layout | and page sequences.
the <fo:region-before> element. | the line-height attribute.
