Having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space | what kind of interface, behavior, functionality to provide- from problem space to design space															
But before | deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model- from problem space to design space															
Need to first think about how the system will | appear to users (i.e. how they will understand it)- conceptual model															
A conceptual model is: | a high-level description of how a system isorganized and operates. (johnson andhenderson, 2002, p. 26)															
Not a description of the user interface but a | structure outlining the concepts and the relationships between them- what is and why need a conceptual model															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | architects and interior designers would not think about which color curtains to have before deciding where the windows will beplaced in a new building															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | enables "designers to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets"															
Why not start with the nuts and bolts of design | provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations															
Orient themselves towards asking | questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by users- helps the design team

A framework is | a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions															
Theories tend to be | comprehensive, explaining human'computer interactions															
Models tend to | simplify some aspect of human'computer interaction															
Frameworks tend to be | prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider															
Need to have a good understanding of the problem space | specifying what it is you aredoing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended															
A conceptual model is ahigh-level description of a product | what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it															
Decisions about conceptual design should be | made before commencing any physical design															
Interface metaphors are | commonly used as part of a conceptual model															
We need to | take into account cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of users															
We can provide knowledge about | what users can and cannot be expected to do															
Identify and explain the nature and causes of problems users encounter | why do we need to understand users															
Supply theories, modelling tools, guidance and methods that can | lead to the design of better interactive products															
Core cognitive aspects | attention, perception and recognition, memory, reading, speaking and listening, problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making, learning															
Core cognitive aspects | most relevant to interaction design are attention,perception and recognition, and memory															
Allows us to focus on information that is | relevant to what we are doing- attention															
Involves audio and/or visual senses | attention															
Selecting things to concentrate on at a point | in time from the mass of stimuli around us- attention															
Focussed and divided attention enables us to be | selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events- attention															
Information at the interface should be structured to capture users' attention | e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows),colour, reverse video, sound and flashing lights- attention															
Tullis (1987) | found that the two screens produced quite different results															
Make information salient | when it needs attending to-design implications for attention															
Use techniques that make things stand out | like colour, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation-design implications for attention															
Avoid cluttering the | interface - follow the google.com example of crisp, simple design-design implications for attention															
Avoid using too much because | the software allows it-design implications for attention															
Representations of information need to be | designed to be perceptible and recognizable- design implications															
Icons and other graphical representations should enable | users to readily distinguish their meaning- design implications															
Bordering and spacing are | effective visual ways of grouping information- design implications															
Sounds should be | audible and distinguishable- design implications															
Speech output should enable | users to distinguish between the set of spoken words- design implications															
Text should be | legible and distinguishable from the background- design implications															
Involves first | encoding and then retrieving knowledge- memory															
We don't remember | everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to - memory															
Context is | important in affecting our memory (i.e., where, when) - memory															
Well known fact that we recognize things much better than being able to recall things | better at remembering images than words, why interfaces are largely visual - memory															
Encoding is first stage of memory | determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted- processing in memory															
The more attention paid to something | processing in memory															
And the more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge | processing in memory															
Context affects the extent to | which information can be subsequently retrieved															
Sometimes it can be difficult for people to | recall information that was encoded in a different context															
Command-based interfaces require users to | recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s- recognition versus recall															
GUIs provide visually-based options that users need only | browse through until they recognize one- recognition versus recall															
Web browsers, MP3 players, etc., provide lists of visited URLs, song titles etc., | that support recognition memory- recognition versus recall															
Personal information management (PIM) is a growing problem for most users | who have vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc.,															
Major problem is | deciding where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again															
Naming most | common means of encoding them															
Memory involves 2 processes | recall-directed and recognition-based scanning															
File management systems should be designed to optimize both kinds of memory processes | e.g., search box and history list															
Help users encode files in richer ways | provide them with ways of saving files using colour, flagging, image, flexible text, time stamping, etc															
Don't overload users memories with | complicated procedures for carrying out tasks- design implications															
Design interfaces that | promote recognition rather than recall- design implications															
Provide users with a variety of ways of encoding digital information to | help them remember where they have stored them  |  e.g., categories, color, flagging, time stamping- Design implications															
Users develop an understanding of a system through | learning and using it- mental models															
Knowledge is often described as a mental model | how to use the system (what to do next), what to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works)- mental models															
People make inferencesusing mental models of | how to carry out tasks- mental models															
Craik (1943) described mental models as | internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made- mental models															
Involves unconscious and conscious processes, | where images and analogies are activated- mental models															
Deep versus shallow models | how to drive a car and how it works- mental models															
Many people have erroneous mental models | (kempton, 1996)															
Payne (1991) | did a similar study and found that people frequently resort to analogies to explain how they work															
People's accounts greatly varied and | were often ad hoc															
Proposes 7 stages of an activity | establish a goal, form an intention, specify an action sequence, execute an action, perceive the system state, interpret the state, evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions															
Human activity does not | proceed in such an orderly and sequential manner															
More usual for stages to be | missed, repeated or out of order															
Do not always | have a clear goal in mind but react to the world															
Theory is only | approximation of what happens and is greatly simplified															
Help designers think about | how to help users monitor their actions															
The 'gulfs' explicate the gaps that exist | between the user and the interface															
The gulf of execution | the distance from the user to the physical system while the second one															
The gulf of evaluation | the distance from the physical system to the user															
Need to bridge the gulfs in order to reduce the cognitive effort required to | perform a task- the gulfs															
Models the information processes of | a user interacting with a computer- model human processor(card et al, 1983)															
Predicts which cognitive processes are | involved when a user interacts with a computer- model human processor(card et al, 1983)															
Enables calculations to be made of | how long a user will take to carry out a task- model human processor(card et al, 1983)															
Concerned with explaining how we interact with external representations | maps, notes, diagrams- external cognition															
Diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-do lists - written | to remind us of what to do- externalizing to reduce memory load															
Post-its, piles, marked emails - where placed indicates priority of | what to do- externalizing to reduce memory load															
External representations | remind us that we need to do something (to buy something for mother's day), remind us of what to do (buy a card), remind us when to do something (send a card by a certain date)															
When a tool is used in conjunction with an external representation | to carry out a computation (e.g. pen and paper)- computational offloading															
Annotation involves modifying existing representations through making marks | crossing off, ticking, underlining- annotation and cognitive tracing															
Cognitive tracing involves externally manipulating items into different orders or structures | playing scrabble, playing cards- annotation and cognitive tracing															
Provide external representations at the interface that | reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading- design implication

How knowledge is | shared and accessed- what's involved															
Cognition involves several processes including | attention, memory, perception and learning															
The way an interface is designed can | greatly affect how well users can perceive, attend, learn and remember how to do their tasks															
Theoretical frameworks such as mental models and external cognition provide ways of | understanding how and why people interact with products, which can lead to thinking about how to design better products															
Various mechanisms and 'rules' are followed when holding a conversation | e.g.mutual greetings- conversational mechanisms															
Sacks et al. (1978) | work on conversation analysis describe three basic rules															
Turn-taking used to | coordinate conversation															
Back channeling to signal to | continue and following															
Much research focus has been on how to | support conversations when people are 'at a distance' from each other-designing technologies to support conversations															
Many applications have been developed | e.g., email, videoconferencing, videophones, computer conferencing, instant messaging, chatrooms-designing technologies to support conversations															
Conversations are | supported in real-time through voice and/or typing															
Examples include | video conferencing, voip,muds and chat

They can provide external information on -Shared external representations | who is working on what, when it is being worked on,where it is being worked on,when a piece of work is supposed to be finished,whom it goes to next															
Involves knowing | who is around, what is happening, and who is talking with whom- awareness mechanisms															
Peripheral awareness | keeping an eye on things happening in the periphery of vision, overhearing and overseeing - allows tracking of what others are doingwithout explicit cues															
Provide awareness of others | who are in different locations- designing technologies to support awareness															
Users notify others as opposed to being | constantly monitored															
Provide information about shared objects and progress of collaborative tasks | tickertape, babble

Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know | what you are doing are important aspects of collaborative working and socialising															
Many collaborative technologies systems have been built | to support collaboration															
HCI has traditionally been about | designing efficient and effective systems- affective aspects															
Now more about how to design interactive systems that make people respondin certain ways | e.g. to be happy, to be trusting, to learn, to be motivated- affective aspects															
Users have created a range ofemoticonscompensate for lack of expressiveness in text communication: | happy:),sad:<,sick:x,mad>:,very angry >:-(- user-created expressiveness															
Also use of icons and shorthand in texting and instant messaging has emotional connotations, | e.g.i 12 cu 2nite-created expressiveness															
Marcus (1992) | proposed interfaces for different user groups															
Left dialog box was | designed for white american females- marcus (1992)

Right dialog box was designed for | european adult male intellectuals- marcus (1992)															
who like "suave prose, a restrained treatment of information density, and a classical approach to font selection" | marcus (1992)															
Teasley et al (1994) found this not to be true | the european dialog box was preferred by all and was considered most appropriate for all users, round dialog box was strongly disliked by everyone															
When an application doesn't work properly or crashes | user frustration															
When a system doesn't do what the user wants it to do | user frustration															
When a user's expectations are not met | user frustration															
When a system does not provide sufficient information to enable the user to know what to do | user frustration															
When error messages pop up that are vague, obtuse or condemning | user frustration															
When the appearance of an interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky or patronizing | user frustration															
When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made earlier and they need to start all over again | user frustration															
Amusing to the designer but not the user | e.g.,clicking on a link to a website only to discover that it is still 'under construction'															
Reeves and Naas (1996) | argue that comput should be made to apologize															
Web used to deceive people into parting with personal details | e.g. paypal, ebay and won the lottery letters- phishing and trust

Believability refers to | the extent to which users come to believe an agent's intentions and personality															
Appearance is very important | are simple cartoon-like characters or more realistic characters, resembling the human form more believable?															
Behaviour is very important | how an agent moves, gestures and refers to objects on the screen, exaggeration of facial expressions and gestures to show underlying emotions (c.f. animation industry)															
when frightened or angry we focus narrowly and body responds by tensing muscles and sweating | more likely to be less tolerant- claims from model															
when happy we are less focused and the body relaxes | more likely to overlook minor problems and be more creative- claims from model															
Jordon (2000) based on | tiger's (1992) framework of pleasure															
Focuses on the pleasurable aspects of our interactions with products | (i) physio-pleasure, (ii) socio-pleasure, (iii) psycho-pleasure, (iv) ideo-pleasure (cognitive)
